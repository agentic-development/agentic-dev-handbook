## Structure

This handbook is organized into chapters that build on each other, but each chapter can also be read independently:

1. **Introduction** (you are here) — What agentic development is and why it matters
2. **Getting Started** — Setting up your environment and running your first agentic workflow

More chapters will be added as the field evolves.

## How to Read

You can read this handbook in two ways:

### Sequential Reading

Start from the beginning and work through each chapter in order. This is recommended if you're new to agentic development and want a comprehensive understanding.

### Reference Reading

Jump to specific topics using the sidebar navigation. Each page is self-contained enough to be useful on its own, with cross-links to related content when deeper context is needed.

## Cross-References

Throughout the handbook, you'll find links to other resources on this site:

- **[Patterns](/en/patterns)** — Proven approaches to common agentic development challenges
- **[Templates](/en/templates)** — Ready-to-use templates for agentic workflows
- **[Playbooks](/en/playbooks)** — Step-by-step guides for specific scenarios
- **[Glossary](/en/glossary)** — Definitions of key terms used throughout the site

These cross-references connect the handbook's conceptual content with practical, actionable resources.

## Contributing
